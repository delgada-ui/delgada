## What is Delgada?

Delgada is a small, wickedly fast, Rust-based frontend compiler that enables developers to write/organize vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with similar ergonomics and composability to a modern frontend framework.

## Getting Started

cd my-delgada-project
npm install
npm start
```
